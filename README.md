# Cat-ch Them All 


***Cat-ch Them All*** is an application that allows users to collect cats in their back yard. Users create an account and will be able to
 buy and place items, such as toys and food, in their yard in order to attract cats to visit. 
The game contains many different cats, with each cat in the game having certain items and food that they like. Cats have varying levels 
of rarity, so users will need build up their yard in order to collect the rarest cats.

Who will use it?

Why is this project of interest to you?

be played casually and has no learning curve
- I also really like cats
